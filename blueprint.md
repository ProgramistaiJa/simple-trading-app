'''# Blueprint: Simple Trading App

## Overview

This document outlines the design, features, and development plan for the Simple Trading App. The application is a web-based platform built with Next.js and Firebase, providing users with a modern and intuitive trading experience. The app has been redesigned with a financial theme, featuring a dark, professional color palette and a clean, minimalist layout.

## Implemented Features & Design

### Core Functionality
-   **User Authentication:** Users can sign up and log in to the application through redesigned, modern forms.
-   **Theme Switching:** A theme switcher allows users to toggle between light and dark modes (functionality to be fully restored post-redesign).

### Design & Styling
-   **Framework:** The application uses Tailwind CSS for styling.
-   **Modern Financial Theme:** The app has been restyled with a contemporary financial aesthetic.
    -   **Color Palette:** A dark-themed palette with `primary` (#0D111C), `secondary` (#161B22), and `accent` (#2F81F7) colors creates a professional and focused atmosphere.
    -   **Typography:** The 'Inter' font is used for its clean and readable characteristics, which is ideal for financial data.
-   **Redesigned Pages:**
    -   **Home Page:** A new, engaging landing page with a clear call-to-action, feature highlights, and a market overview section.
    -   **Login/Signup Pages:** The authentication forms have been updated to match the new dark theme, providing a seamless user experience.
-   **Responsive Design:** The layout is designed to be responsive and work on different screen sizes.

### Project Structure
-   **`/app`:** App Router for file-based routing.
-   **`/components`:** Reusable UI components, including a new `Icons.tsx` for SVG icons.
-   **`/lib`:** Utility functions and libraries.
-   **`ThemeContext.tsx`:** React context for managing the application's theme.
-   **`AuthProvider.tsx`:** React context for managing user authentication.

## Development Plan

With the new design in place, the next steps will focus on building out the core trading functionalities and restoring the theme switcher.

1.  **Dashboard Page:** Create a personalized dashboard for logged-in users, displaying portfolio overview, watchlists, and market news.
2.  **Trading Page:** Implement a feature-rich trading interface with advanced charting, order forms, and real-time data.
3.  **Portfolio Page:** Develop a detailed portfolio view where users can track their assets, performance, and transaction history.
4.  **Restore Theme Switcher:** Re-integrate the theme switcher to work with the new design, ensuring it is accessible and functional.
5.  **Firebase Integration:** Connect the application to Firebase for real-time data, authentication, and other backend services.
